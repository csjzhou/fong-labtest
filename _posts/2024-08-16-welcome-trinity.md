Today was Match Day at Cristo Rey Atlanta, and we are thrilled that high school senior, Trinity Calvin, matched with our group!  Trinity is an aspiring engineer and president of her school robotics club.  We're excited for her to join our team and advances our efforts in mechanical design and community outreach.
