We're excited to welcome Morgan Bade for a graduate research rotation! Morgan is an MD/PhD student at Emory, and starting her PhD training this year.  She is passionate about vision research (woot woot!) and will join us for upcoming month and a half to investigate homeostatic plasticity in the ON visual pathway.  We're excited to see what she discovers!  Welcome, Morgan!
