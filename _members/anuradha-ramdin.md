Anuradha Ramdin is an undergraduate student at University of Miami (UM) studying biomedical engineering, and is a [SURE Scholar](https://sure.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech.  She is broadly interested in neuroplasticity and cardiovascular diseases, as well as designing novel medical devices that are accessible to people in low-income communities. At UM, Anuradha previously conducted spinal cord injury research and constructed nerve cuffs for vagus nerve stimulation. At Georgia Tech, she is working in the Fong lab to design and build a high-throughput neurophysiology suite for multi-sensory stimulation, and study different strategies for driving visual cortical plasticity.

Tenure in lab: Summer 2023 ([SURE Scholar](https://sure.gatech.edu/))
