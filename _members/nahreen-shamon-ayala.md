Nahreen is an undergraduate in Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech working on designing an apparatus to monitor visually-guided behavior in freely-moving mice.  She originally joined the lab as a high school student at Cristo Rey Atlanta Jesuit High School and a scholar in the Emory Department of Human Genetics [Next Gen Internship program](https://med.emory.edu/departments/human-genetics/next-gen.html). She is interested in applications of 3D printing for creating affordable assistive devices for individuals with physical disabilities. Nahreen has also contributed to outreach efforts in the lab in partnership with the [Center for the Visually Impaired](https://cviga.org/), including repair of Perkins Braillers and organizing STEM workshops for blind and visually-impaired youth.
